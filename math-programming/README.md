# math-programming

A math programming library.

This library is designed to formulate and solve math programs, in
particular linear programs and mixed-integer linear programs. This
library offers a generic frontend to solve backends, such as the [GLPK
backend](../math-programming-glpk/README.md).

See the
[`math-programming-tests`](../math-programming-tests/README.md)
package for examples of solving linear and integer programming problems.
